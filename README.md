# Harrys Book Shop

My solution for the (popular?) book shop discount programming exercise.

## Requirements

Just [Python](https://www.python.org/).

## Usage

Clone

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/sokotim/harrys-book-shop.git
```
or [download](https://github.com/sokotim/harrys-book-shop/archive/master.zip) and extract.

Change into project directory

```bash
$ cd harrys-book-shop
```

Run tests (currently failing) with

```bash
$ python tests.py
```
